# batching-algorithm-semiconductor-manufacturing-implementation
This is a Java model based on the artciel "A batching and scheduling algorithm for the diffusion area in semiconductor manufacturing" by Claude Yugma, Stéphane Dauzère-Pérès, Christian Artigues, Alexandre Derreumaux and Olivier Sibille\
Aiming to optimize batching and scheduling of waffer jobs in a semi conductor production.
